/*
 * Thread Class vs Runnable Interface
 * 
 * 1 If we extend the Thread class, our class cannot extend any other class
 * because Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance. But, if we implement the
 * Runnable interface, our class can still extend other base classes.
 * 
 * 2 We can achieve basic functionality of a thread by extending Thread class
 * because it provides some inbuilt methods like yield(), interrupt() etc. that
 * are not available in Runnable interface.
